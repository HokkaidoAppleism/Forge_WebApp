"""Gemini, called with whichever player's key is making the request.

The desktop keeps one module-level `GeminiGetter` holding one key, because a
desktop app is one process for one person. That shape does not survive a
server: a shared instance whose `key` attribute is reassigned per request is
one thread away from calling Gemini with somebody else's credentials and
billing them for it. The bug would be intermittent, invisible in testing, and
would show up as a stranger's quota being spent.

So a `GeminiGetter` is built **per request**, from the key belonging to the
account that asked. Nothing about the caller's identity is passed in from the
request body: the key is looked up by `g.user_id`, which comes from the
verified token, exactly like every other resource in this API.

The prompts, retry policy, JSON parsing and error wording used to be reused
from `forge_backend/geminiGetter.py` unmodified; that file is now a vendored
copy (`web/api/geminiGetter.py`) for the same reason `rec_logic/` is -- see
adaptive.py's module docstring. Same drift risk, same mitigation (check here
by hand if the desktop's version changes).

Importing geminiGetter has one side effect worth knowing about: it creates
an app-data directory (`~/.config/ForgeQB` on Linux) at import time. Empty
and harmless on a server, but it is a real mkdir, not nothing.

    de-duplication debt already recorded for `answerline.py` in

    builds import, not to keep two copies indefinitely. `adaptive.py` and the
    Gemini prompts above are the counter-example -- those import cleanly and
    so were *not* copied.

    The prompt asks for a bare JSON array, but models routinely wrap it in
    code fences or bracket it with chat ("Here are the flashcards:" / "Let me
    know if you want more!"). Stripping only the exact string "```json" left
    all of those unparseable, and the user saw "the AI returned an invalid
