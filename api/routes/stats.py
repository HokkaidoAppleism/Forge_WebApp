"""Lifetime numbers, the practice streak, and the five analysis panels.

Everything here aggregates in Postgres rather than pulling rows out and summing
them in Python. That is not premature: `select * from user_stats` is unbounded
in the number of games played, and the answer is nine numbers however many rows
back it.

The panels are the same principle taken seriously. On the desktop each one is a
matplotlib PNG rendered on the server and returned as base64 inside a JSON
body; here the routes return numbers and a written finding, and the browser
draws. The reasoning ports unchanged and lives in `panels.py`; only the picture
was thrown away.

Three of the five change query shape on the way over, and all three for the
same reason -- work that belongs in the database was being done in Python:

  * **Where You Buzz** ran one query per band, four round trips for four
    numbers. One grouped query now.
  * **The neg autopsy** selected every qualifying row of `user_stats` and
    bucketed them in a loop. It is a cross-tab; Postgres does cross-tabs. At
    most eleven difficulties by four bands comes back instead of the whole
    answer history.
  * **Ceiling's tier labels** grouped all 169,056 questions on every request.
    Cached per process now -- see `_tier_labels`.

Scoping matches either level of the category, `(category = %s or subcategory =
%s)`. On the desktop build the profile filtered on `category` alone while
adaptive sessions logged the subcategory, so 17 of 20 filters silently matched
zero rows and every panel came up empty -- and the three that worked were the
categories that happen to mirror their own name, which made the feature look
like it worked.

      no business erasing.
    * **The review queue, the notebook, and Adaptive Learning's skill model
      all survive too.** A neg you are still relearning does not stop being
      unlearned because the number that counted it got reset, a saved note is
      not a stat, and `category_user_state` is a model of what you know, not
      a scoreboard -- resetting the scoreboard should not un-teach the
      recommender everything it has learned about you. The desktop reset
      leaves all three alone as well; nothing here is a new decision.
