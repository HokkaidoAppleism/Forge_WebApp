"""AI features: one GeminiGetter per request, built from the caller's own key.

Three of four now. Explanations proved `ai.for_user()` -> a real Gemini call
-> a real response works end to end; flashcard and study-guide generation
below are built on the same shape. Knowledge Depth (naming a player's topic
clusters) is not here -- it needs its own per-cluster accuracy panel built
first, which nothing in panels.py does yet, and bolting the naming call onto
a panel that doesn't exist would be building the smaller half of a bigger
feature.

Same rule as every other route here: **anything that decides what Gemini is
asked about is read off the database, never trusted from the request body.**
The question and its answer come from `public.questions` by id, and the
clues a study guide is built from come from this account's own `user_clues`
rows -- never from a request body, which is what stops a client from getting
Gemini to write about arbitrary text at this account's expense.
