"""Database access, always inside a transaction that knows whose it is.

Two things happen on every request that touches user data, and the second one
is the one worth reading twice:

  1. The connection switches to the `authenticated` role for the duration of
     the transaction. The role the pool logs in as can see every row in every
     table; `authenticated` sees only what a policy lets it. Without this line
     the policies in 0002_user_data.sql are written, enabled, and never
     consulted -- which is indistinguishable from working right up until the
     day a query forgets its WHERE clause.

  2. The verified user id is put on the transaction as `request.jwt.claims`,
     which is where Supabase's `auth.uid()` reads from. That is what the
     policies compare each row against.

Both are transaction-local (`set_config(..., true)`), so they unwind when the
transaction ends and cannot leak onto the next request that borrows the same
pooled connection.

Application code still writes `where user_id = %s` on top of this. The belt is
RLS; the braces are the WHERE clause. Either alone would be enough on a good
day, and the point is not to depend on a good day.
